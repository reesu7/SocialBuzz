# SocialBuzz
In this project, I developed a social media sentiment analysis tool that classifies tweets as positive or negative. The objective was to analyze the sentiment of social media posts, particularly tweets, to gain insights into public opinion and emotional responses towards various topics, brands, or events.







## Methodology

To achieve accurate sentiment classification, I experimented with three different machine learning models:

- Bernoulli Naive Bayes

- Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

- Logistic Regression


## Results 
 - Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Achieved an accuracy of 80%.
 - Linear SVC: Achieved an accuracy of 82% .
 - Logistic Regression: Achieved the highest accuracy of 83%.
## Features

- Real-time Tweet Fetching: Fetches tweets about a specific topic in real-time from Twitter using the Twitter API.Continuously updates the sentiment analysis as new tweets are posted.

- Sentiment Analysis on Tweets: Classifies fetched tweets into positive or negative categories using a Logistic Regression model.Displays positive and negative tweets separately for easy comparison and analysis.

- Sentiment Analysis on Individual Sentences: Allows users to input any sentence and receive instant sentiment analysis results.Provides immediate feedback on the sentiment (positive or negative) of the given sentence.
